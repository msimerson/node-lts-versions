# Node.js versions

Avoid needing to update your CI config files for every Node.js release or EOL event.

This action retrieves a list of Node.js [release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) versions and exports the versions for consumption by automated processes.

The output of the yaml function is designed to populate a GitHub Actions matrix declaration so that your CI is testing with the version(s) of Node.js you choose, typically the **LTS** version(s).

### Usage

This action has the following outputs:

- `active` are Active LTS versions
- `maintenance` are Maintenance LTS versions
- `lts` is all LTS versions (active + maintenance)
- `current` is the Current node version
- `min` is the lowest LTS version

#### active

The currently active Node.js version. This is like a baton that is handed from one version of Node.js to the next.

#### maintenance

Every version of Node.js that is actively maintained by the Node.js project.

#### lts

Similar to maintenance, except it excludes odd number releases that are never considered Long Term Stable. This is the target most modules should use in their CI tests.

#### current

The `current` version would usually be used in your CI tests to always tests your code against the latest Node.js version, but perhaps without failing the CI tests.

#### min

The `min` version is the lowest supported version of Node.js. It couple be used for modules with scarce updates, whose SLA is a best effort to support _any_ version of Node.js.

#### manually (the normal way)

```yaml
test:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
      node-version: [20, 22]
    fail-fast: false
  steps:
```

#### automatically

```yaml
test:
  needs: get-lts
  strategy:
    matrix:
      os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
      node-version: ${{ fromJson(needs.get-lts.outputs.lts) }}
    fail-fast: false
  steps:
get-lts:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - id: get
      uses: msimerson/node-lts-versions@v1
  outputs:
    active: ${{ steps.get.outputs.active }}
    maintenance: ${{ steps.get.outputs.maintenance }}
    lts: ${{ steps.get.outputs.lts }}
    current: ${{ steps.get.outputs.current }}
    min: ${{ steps.get.outputs.min }}
```

### Example

```sh
âœ— node main.js
::set-output name=active::["22"]
::set-output name=maintenance::["18","20"]
::set-output name=lts::["18","20","22"]
::set-output name=current::["23"]
::set-output name=min::"18"
```

#### RAW

```js
const ltsv = require('node-lts-versions')
ltsv.fetchLTS().then(() => {
  console.log(ltsv.json())
  console.log(ltsv.yaml())
  ltsv.print()
})
```

### Methods

#### fetchLTS

Retrieves Node.js version information.

#### json

Display Node.js version information in JSON format.

```js
> ltsv.json('active')
'["22"]'
> ltsv.json('lts')
'["18","20","22"]'
> ltsv.json()
'["23"]'
```

#### yaml

Display Node.js version information in YAML format.

```js
> ltsv.yaml('lts')
[ '18', '20', '22' ]
> ltsv.yaml('active')
[ '22' ]
> ltsv.yaml('maintenance')
[ '18', '20' ]
> ltsv.yaml('current')
[ '23' ]
```

#### print

Display Node.js version information in tabular format.

```
Ver Codename    Latest Release          LTS Period

```
